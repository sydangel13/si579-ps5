This repository uses 3 JavaScript libraries: moment.js, granim.js and d3.js. 

The moment library was used to indicate how much time is left until the first official day of Summer 2021 (June 6, 2021). 
The granim library was used to create a colorful gradient overlay on the lake picture shown on the site. 
The d3 library was used to create a word cloud of words often associated with the summertime.
